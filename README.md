# python-boring-stuff
 Welcome to my Python journey! This repository contains Python scripts I wrote when I was starting out. These projects helped me understand the basics of programming, problem-solving, and working with Python.

ðŸš€ What's Inside?
Here, youâ€™ll find scripts covering:

ðŸ“Œ Basic syntax and data types
ðŸ”„ Loops and conditionals
ðŸ“Š Simple data structures (lists, dictionaries, tuples)
ðŸ“‚ File handling and basic I/O
ðŸ”¢ Math and algorithmic exercises

ðŸ’¡ Why This Repo?
I created this repository to track my learning progress and help other beginners find simple Python examples to practice with.
